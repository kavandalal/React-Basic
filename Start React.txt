-go to the folder where you want to save the files 
-open cmd there, write "npm init"  and write all the necessary things, that will create package.json in the folder


To install packages 
- go to the folder, open cmd, write "npm install <package-name>"

package.json -> dependecies 


Start building with react from create-react-app by facbook in github(https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- install latest version of create-react-app by writing "npm install -g create-react-app", we recommend you uninstall the package using "npm uninstall -g create-react-app" or "yarn global remove create-react-app" to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.
- go to the folder where you want the files to be and open cmd, write "npx create-react-app <app-name>" (it will take some time to creat the files)
- go inside that file and write "npm start"(will start a local server)
- from "src" folder you can delete everthing except index.js file
(while writing npm start if you get an error, try typin "npm install" that will install all the dependecies(pakages) required that are writting in packages.json file)
- after completing the project yo ucan write "npm run build" will crate a build forder, and upload that build forder in anywhere to host the site
